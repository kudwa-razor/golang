Channels BUffering:

- Basically channels are unbuffered, meaning; they will only accept sends(chan <-) if there is a corresponding receive(<- chan) 
  ready to receive that value.

-Buffered channels accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values.
Ex:
channel of strings buffering upto 2 values:

   messages := make(chan string, 2)

-Because this channel is buffered, we can send these values into the channel without a corresponding concurrent receive.
   
    messages <- "buffered"
    messages <- "channel"

- We can later receive these two values as usual:
     fmt.Println("<- messages")
