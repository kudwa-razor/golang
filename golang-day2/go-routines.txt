GO-ROUTINE:
-A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution.

- we invoke a normal function to goroutine style this way:
 go f("goroutine") i.e go f(s).

 - You can also start a goroutine for an anonymous function call.
 Ex: prefix go keyword in the start of the function itself.
 go func(msg string) {
        fmt.Println(msg)
    }("going")

- see gourtine code.
