Concurrency:
 -Relates to an application that is processing more than one task at the same time. 
 -Concurrency is an approach that is used for decreasing the response time of the system by using the single processing unit.
 - Concurrency creates the "illusion of parallelism", however actually the chunks of a task aren’t parallelly processed, but inside the 
    application, there are more than one task is being processed at a time. 
 -It doesn’t fully end one task before it begins ensuing. 
 - Conc is achieved by context switching, increases the amt of work finished at a time. 

- Major disadv is context switching overhead ig.

Parallelism:
 -Parallelism is related to an application where  tasks are divided into smaller sub-tasks that are processed 
  simultaneously or parallel. 
 -It is used to increase the throughput and computational speed of the system by using multiple processors.
 - It enables single sequential CPUs to do lot of things “seemingly” simultaneously.
