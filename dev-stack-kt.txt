---------- This entire video contains 3 parts. 1)normal dev stack work  2)Hard/Hot reloading  3) 
1)ST PART:
So devstack usecase will help you in deploying the changes with a customized seperate URL so no once can hamper with your changes.
Helmfile Commands:
1) helmfile sync : which syncs all the changes to github, takes all the changes which you have done in the commit-id and deploy there.
2) helmfile delete : helps you delete those pods which have devstack label (ex: api-jasmeet)


2 ways to access the POD (17:48)

2)ND PART:
How hard reloading works (24:48 - 27:20)
-simple changes will be made in  a go and you do not have to make helmfile sync again.

27:22 -    ->Smthng idk 

34:02 -     -> Changing the links in the API? admin dashboard to API ig.


3) idk properly

4) When you deploy some changes on your dev stack and you want to add a new route:(44:50 - ):
basically youve deployed some changes using the helmfile sync and now you want to add a new route/ change route of some service or change 
the permission of a route -> This thing wont be reflected using "hot reloading" command



See what these commands do:
-kubectl config use context dev-serve
-kubectl get pods -n api
-kubectl logs <your-pod-name> -n api -> If you want to access the log of a specific pod.
-kubectl logs <your-pod-name> -n api -f -> Itll come in read state and continue reading.
-devspace dev -> will find your pod and come to a log streaming form.
-kubectl get pods -n terminals
-kubectl logs terminals-live-jasmeet -n terminals -f 
-kubectl -n api exec -it api-web-jasmeet -- sh -->THis will give you shell access of your pod.
