From slide 14/17 , I have only written important slide nos. to look @ and dont code everything.

1)14/17
When the right hand side of the declaration is typed, the new variable is of that same type:

var i int
j := i // j is an int 

2)15/17
Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
ex: inside the main:

const Pi = 3.14
func main() {
	const World = "世界"
	fmt.Println("Hello", World)
	fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")

	const Lie = "YES!"
	fmt.Println("Are you gay?", Lie)
} 

the above gives output:
Hello 世界
Happy 3.14 Day
Are you gay? YES!

3)16/17
High precision values, large no of decimal points ... should gpt a bit. ** 
there are doubts. Code not very clear.


After this it is directly For loop slides.
