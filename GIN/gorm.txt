// take from the GORM link given.

-GORM is a code first ORM library for Go lang allows to create as well as interact with database schema.
-gorm.model (1:35 - )  -any key called ID - will be considered primary key.

-Auto migration tool:  automatically migrates your schema, to keep your schema update to date.
 - The above tool will only create tables, missing columns and missing indexes, it wont change existing column's type or delete unused 
    columns to protect your data.

 -GORM makes heavy use of method-chaining.

 -Error handling with GORM (21:25 - 22:24):

 - Soft delete (15:27 - ) -> If a model has DeletedAt field, it will get a soft delete. So, when calling Delete, the record will not be 
    permanently removed from the database, rather the DeletedAt's value will be set to the current time.

 - (19:00 - 22) -> certain key words.
